Every Programmer must know why he codes. He needs to know his design. Here is something to start with:
[Design of a Programmer](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/639609)

I have been creating a library of important codes, that might come handy at need. You can find my library here at [Day-Today Codes](https://github.com/prakashbh/day-today-codes). If you create and have a library of your own, well, you should!

### Course Notes:
**Chapter 01: Introduction to Data Strucutres and Recursion**

We start with [Introduction Notes](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/1-intro-to-ds-recursion.pdf) which talks of C basics covering pointers and other programming constructs. The chapter also covers the basics of iteration, recursion and backtracking. To study about the strucutres in detail, refer the ebook: [Structures and C](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/644937). An extended notes of more recursion examples can be found here [Extended Notes  - Recursion.](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/1-recursion-examples.pdf)

**Chapter 02: Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues**

We basically study two class of problems and map them to data structures: stacks and queues. The theory along with the variants can be downloaded here: [Theory](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/2-lists-stack-queue-theory.pdf). We then check out the implementations which can be found here: [Implementations](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/2-stacks-queues-lists-implementation.pdf). We further go ahead and explore the applications and further types which can be found here: [Applications](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/2-stacks-queues-lists-continued.pdf). The chapter also has an activity book. You can get it here: [Activity Book](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/2-stacks-queues-lists-activity-book.pdf).

**Chapter 03: Hashing**

Hashing is a blackbox. Hashing is also a magic box that is applicable in various computer science domains. Read the notes here from the ebook: [Hashing](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/737188).


**Test Yourself**
Did you enjoy the 100 Questions Challenge? you can get the challenge questions here: [100 Questions Challenge](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/100-questions-challenge-2018.pdf). The Mock Minor 1 question paper is here: [Mock Minor 01](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/mock-minor-01.pdf).

Also note that the class had many short handout quzzies. Look out for them!


**Chapter 04: Trees and Graphs**

to be updated soon. 

**Chapter 05: Fundamentals of ALgorithms and Sorting**

This chapter does not have detailed notes. All sorting algorithms are out togther in this handout: [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2018/blob/master/course-notes/sorting-algorithms.pdf).
